# Luxopus

https://github.com/rwb196884/Luxopus

A more obvious name might have been `Octolux`; therefore I didn't choose it.

LUXpower / Octopus control

## Installation

## Configuration

If `/etc/luxopus.config` exists then it will be used.

To run the command line version in linux:
```
$ dotnet run --environment=linux Rwb.Luxopus.Console/Rwb.Luxopus.Console.csproj`
```

### Prerequisites

You require:
* a LUX Power inverter,
* an Octopus Energy account, and
* an installation of InfluxDB and an API key.

### Windows

### Linux

If you're using a Debian based system that uses `systemd` then you're in luck. Otherwise you're on your own.
